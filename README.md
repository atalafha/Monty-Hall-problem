Monty Hall Problem: Shiny App Simulation

# Introduction

What is the Monty Hall Problem?
The Monty Hall problem is a fascinating probability puzzle inspired by a game show scenario. Contestants choose from three doors, with a car behind one and goats behind the others. After selecting a door, the host (who knows what lies behind each door) opens another door to reveal a goat. Contestants are then faced with a choice: stick with their initial pick or switch to the other unopened door. Which strategy offers the best chance of winning the car?

# About the Repository

##  Purpose:
This Shiny app aims to offer a dynamic and interactive way to explore the Monty Hall problem. Users can simulate the game multiple times to empirically discover the best strategy, making this a powerful educational tool.

## Contents:

MontyHallShinyApp.R: Shiny app main scripts.

# How to Use

## Requirements:

R with Shiny package installed.
Other required R packages: shiny, shinydashboard, ggplot2

## Setup:

App Features

## Simulate & Visualize:
Users can simulate the Monty Hall problem multiple times and instantly visualize the outcomes, observing the probabilities of winning when sticking vs. switching.

## Educational Insights:
The app provides explanatory notes, helping users understand the counter-intuitive results.

# For Educators

# Teaching Tips:

Begin with a discussion on initial perceptions. Ask students if they'd switch or stick and why.
Use the app to simulate the game, comparing empirical results with students' initial intuitions.
Engage in a discussion about conditional probability and its role in the Monty Hall problem.
Interactive Element:
Encourage students to run their own simulations and hypothesize about variations of the game (e.g., more doors).
